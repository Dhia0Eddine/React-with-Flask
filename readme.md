# Events Management App (React + Flask)

This is a small learning project demonstrating a simple full-stack setup using React and Flask.

## Project Structure

### Frontend (React)

- Located in the `frontend/` folder
- Structured with modular folders:
    - `pages/` – for top-level views like ViewSpeakers, EventRegistration
    - `components/` – for reusable UI like SpeakerForm
    - `hooks/` – for logic (e.g., form handling)
- Uses Axios to communicate with the backend (see `services/`)
- Talks to Flask via `API_URL`

### Backend (Flask)

- Located in the `backend/` folder
- Organized using Blueprints
- Contains:
    - `routes.py` – defines API endpoints
    - `models/` – SQLAlchemy models
    - `uploads/` – image uploads
    - `utils/` – helper functions

## Communication

- Frontend calls backend REST APIs using Axios
- Flask serves data and image files
- File uploads saved to `backend/uploads`

## Status

- In development, focused on learning
- Basic CRUD for speakers and registrations
- Update implemented, delete pending
- No authentication or advanced features yet

> **Note:** Run each server separately. Frontend runs on `localhost:3000`, backend on `localhost:5000`.
